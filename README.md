# Note to all our Members

### Set your profile visibility to 'Public'. 
### And DO NOT use your USN as your GitHub username.

## Repo Guidelines :
Please create Repos beginning with your Branch name,
Example Repo name : ISE_Mini_Projects_2019

Add that repo to your respective sub-team ( 2nd year or 3rd year ) and provide write access for that team only.
( it is available in Repository settings -> Manage Access )

And ask students to clone this Repo, and create folders with their name and USN.

For Example :
Inside the Repo, student folders can look like this
4AL15IS000_Chandan_Shastri

It will be consistent and will be easy for all the faculty members to monitor.
